        "long_description": "### Overview\nThe Data Analyzer Bot helps you get a quick understanding of your tabular datasets (CSV or Excel files). Upload your data, and the bot will perform an automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), saving all results locally. The output includes:\n\n*   **Data Profile:** Key statistics like row/column counts, data types, missing value analysis, descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, stddev, min/max), and frequency counts for categorical columns.\n*   **Automated Visualizations:** Common charts such as histograms for numerical distributions, bar charts for categorical frequencies, and a correlation heatmap for numerical features. These are saved as image files.\n*   **LLM-Powered Summary:** A natural language summary of the dataset's characteristics and 2-3 potentially interesting observations or anomalies, generated by an LLM.\n*   **Consolidated HTML Report:** An HTML file (`report.html`) is generated in your specified output directory, which you can open in any web browser to view all analyses and visualizations in one place.\n\nThis bot is designed for local execution to ensure your data remains private. It's perfect for data analysts needing a quick first look, business users wanting to understand data without coding, or anyone needing a rapid, standardized report on a dataset.\n\n### How it Works\n1.  The user provides a path to a local CSV or Excel file and an output directory.\n2.  The bot uses libraries like Pandas to load and analyze the data programmatically.\n3.  It generates statistical summaries and visualizations (e.g., using Matplotlib/Seaborn), saving charts as image files.\n4.  This structured information (statistics, chart data/descriptions) is then passed to an LLM (e.g., via OpenAI API) to generate human-readable summaries and insights, saved as text.\n5.  All results, including the summary, chart images, and a main `report.html`, are saved to the user's specified local output directory.",
