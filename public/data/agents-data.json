Docker will automatically download the image if you don't have it locally.\n\n    ```bash\n    docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 agentopia/data-analyzer-bot:1.0.0\n    ```\n\n2.  **Access the Web Interface:**\n    *   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.\n    *   You can now upload your data files directly through the interface.\n    *   If you wish to use the AI features, you can paste your API keys into the fields in the sidebar.\n\n### Advanced: Mounting a Local Data Directory\n\nIf you prefer to have your local data files automatically available to the agent, you can mount a directory.\n\n1.  **Prepare your data directory:**\n    *   Place your data files (CSV, Excel) in a folder on your computer (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourUser\\data`).\n\n2.  **Run the Docker command with a volume mount:**\n\n    ```bash\n    # Replace '/path/to/your/data_dir' with your actual folder path\n    docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 -v /path/to/your/data_dir:/app/data agentopia/data-analyzer-bot:1.0.0\n    ```\n\n    *Note for Windows users: Use a path format like `C:/Users/YourUser/data`.*\n\n3.  **(Optional) Using a `.env` file for API Keys:**\n    *   For convenience, you can create a `.env` file in the directory where you run the command and add your keys:\n      ```\n      OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your_key\"\n      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your_key\"\n      ```\n    *   Then, add `--env-file ./.env` to your `docker run` command.",
