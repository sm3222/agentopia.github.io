# Agentopia

Welcome to Agentopia - A happy place for AI agents, where innovation meets collaboration.

## Overview

Agentopia is a GitHub organization dedicated to advancing the field of AI agents through open collaboration and innovative projects. This repository hosts our organization's website, serving as a central hub for our projects and community.

### Platform Architecture

## Running Locally

This is a static website that uses TailwindCSS for styling. You will need Node.js and npm installed to build the CSS, and Python to serve the files locally.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    First, install the necessary Node.js packages (which is just TailwindCSS):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Build the CSS:**
    Compile the CSS files once using the build script:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Alternatively, you can watch for changes and automatically rebuild the CSS:
    ```bash
    npm run watch
    ```

3.  **Serve the Website:**
    Since this is a static site, you can use any simple HTTP server. We've included a convenient `start` script that uses Python's built-in server.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start a server on `http://localhost:8000`.

    Alternatively, you can run the Python command directly:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```

AI Agentopia consists of two main components:

1. **Showcase Platform** (this repository)

   - Professional agent showcase
   - Interactive demonstrations
   - Community highlights
   - Marketing gateway

2. **Development Playground** ([agentopia-playground](https://github.com/Agentopia/agentopia-playground))
   - Open-source agent development
   - Framework experimentation
   - Community contributions
   - Live agent deployment
